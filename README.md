## About

tile-saturate is a simple web-app that opens a webcam in the browser and applies a filter based on the orientation of the mobile device being used.  Tile the device clockwise, and the video feed will become more [saturated](https://photographylife.com/what-is-saturation-and-how-to-get-optimal-saturation).  Tile it counter-clockwise, and it will become more greyscale.
